write an ansible playbook that uses k8s_nodes that will do the following instructions:
1) Get a list of all deployments with 'web' in their name by running a shell command and filtering the results to only show the namespace and deployment name and save them in two variables, 'deployment_name', 'name_space'.
2) Use the kubectl command to list all  namespaces.
3) Display the output of step 2 in JSON format.
